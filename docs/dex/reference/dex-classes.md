# The DexClass
`poketypes.dex.dexdata_pb2` OR directly import from `poketypes.dex`

## Basics
Each DexClass is an auto-generated Enum using google's protobuf library, and the `poketypes.protos` module. In order to use these Enums, you do *not* need to have the library installed, however if you want to generate your own Enums in this way, or modify how the existing ones are generating, you will need to do so.

Follow the steps in the [contributing](../../about/contributing.md) to get your local environment setup if you want to develop changes for these Enums.
