# Changelog

Changelog will not be 100% accurate until the official 1.0.0 release. Right now each release is a mash-up of various message tweaks, documenation additions, field reworkings, etc..

I'll try to keep a generally accurate log until then mostly for my own benefit, but take it with a grain of salt
