# Welcome to the Poketypes Docs!

This site contains the project documentation for the `poketypes` project, whose goal is to provide *clear*, *consistent*, *correct* data about Pokemon, using the same base data as Pokemon Showdown.


## Table Of Contents

This package provides two very useful modules for handling Pokemon data:

- `dex`: contains Pokemon Enums, Data Classes, and an instantiated information center `Gen`
- `showdown`: provides two main classes `Message` and `BattleMessage`, for processing showdown communications

Based on the needs of your project, you may need one or both of these.
